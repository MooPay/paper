# MOO Tokenomics and Emission
---

The MooPay Token (MOO) is the fuel for the MooPay ecosystem of products and services. It is also its native cryptocurrency. The token economics have been constructed in such a way that as the network is used, the overall supply of tokens reduces over time.

50% of all MOO tokens will be burnt over time, as there is more network usage and fee collection.

40% of the fee generated will be burnt. 30% will be used to incentivize the token holders and 30% will be added to the treasury, to support product development and future improvements.
